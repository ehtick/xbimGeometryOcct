# Xbim.Geometry.Occt

This Nuget package contains Open CASCADE 7.7.0 libraries used by xbim Geometry Engine v6+ which are dynamically linked into
the xbim software.

## Building

You must build the OpenCascade libraries first as per the [Solution Readme](../Readme.md)

Note: Due to the inclusion of the 8000+ header files in the nuget pack, building can take a few minutes.
